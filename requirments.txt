Since I'm not going to be paying chrome 5$ to add this extension on the web store, if you want to use it just download the repo files in one folder then head to chrome -> manage extensions -> enable developer mode (top right corner) -> load unpacked and choose the folder you downloaded.  


for a desktop notification version use the master branch.
for a chrome only version use the script-inject branch.
